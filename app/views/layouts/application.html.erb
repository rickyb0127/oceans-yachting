          Captain Aaron Abramowitz has spent 20+ years in the yachting industry. In his early teens he discovered a love for the water operating family boats and sailing on the New England waterways and lakes. His professional career started on tall ships sailing the East and West Coast. These non-profit programs focused on youth educational programs, leadership development, and the preservation of the North American maritime heritage. Aaron’s inclination towards problem solving quickly led him down the path of Captain and Engineer where he learned how to sail, expect the unexpected, diagnose and solve technical issues, and break down the inner-workings of the ship. Aaron earned his Masters license in his early 20’s and shifted from tall ships to sailing yachts. This is where Aaron’s knowledge of vessel engineering, his love of sailing, and his desire to provide a first-class experience to owners and guests came together.  Aaron continued to accumulate professional experience with superyachts as he captained in the Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean, and eventually around the world.  He has planned and managed many multi million dollar yacht refits, annual yard periods, and takes pride in keeping programs on time, on budget and in compliance while minimizing downtime and cost.
          From tall ships to modern sailing and motor yachts, Aaron has operated and managed the largest and most expensive yachts in the industry. His depth of experience, his operational savvy and commitment to providing first class service makes him uniquely qualified as a Yacht Manager.
